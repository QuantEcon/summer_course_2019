# QuantEcon-RSE Intensive Course on Computational Modeling

This is the homepage for the 2019 QuantEcon-RSE Intensive Course on
Computational Modeling, jointly organized by the [Research School of
Economics](https://www.rse.anu.edu.au/) (RSE) at ANU, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and the Australian Treasury.

The event is sposored by RSE.


## Location and Dates

The course will be held at Australian National University in Canberra.

#### Lectures

* Dates: Monday 16th Dec -- Friday 20th Dec 2019
* Hours: 9am -- 5pm, Monday to Friday
* Lecture Room: [Fred Gruen Seminar Room](https://studentvip.com.au/anu/main/maps/84590), HW Arndt Building, RSE

#### Social events

* Day 1 Mon 16 Dec -- Welcome Dinner, RSE terrace Courtyard 5-7pm
* Day 4 Thurs 19 Dec -- Workshop Dinner at Badger and Co

## Equipment

Participants are expected to bring a laptop with the latest version of
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed.

## Prior to Arrival

Prior to arrival, all participants are expected to read and step through all 6 lectures in the
section [Introduction to Python](https://python.quantecon.org/index_learning_python.html) of the [QuantEcon Python lectures](https://python.quantecon.org).

Please anticipate spending at least one hour per lecture on this task.

All participants are required to sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com/),
since we will be using it to communicate and share code throughout the
workshop.


## Contacts

* John Stachurski (RSE, ANU, co-organizer)
* Sebastian Wende (Treasury, co-organizer)
* Nicole Millar (RSE, ANU, administration)


## Teaching Schedule

There will be a sequence of morning lectures and several ad hoc, informal
lectures in the afternoon.  Exercises will be provided in the morning lectures
and participants are invited to remain in the seminar room for exercises
throughout the afternoon.  A teaching assistant will be present to provide
help.
